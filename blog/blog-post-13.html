<p>You've found an item for $120, but it's on sale for 15% off. You want to know the final price, but the mental math feels a bit tricky. Don't worry, we've got you covered! It’s a common question, and we’ll break it down for you.</p>

<p>The short answer is: <strong>15% off of 120 is 102.</strong> The discount saves you $18.</p>

<p>But how do we get that number? Understanding the process is simple and can help you calculate any discount you come across while shopping. Let's walk through it.</p>

<h2>How to Calculate 15% Off 120: The Step-by-Step Method</h2>
<p>There are a couple of ways to figure this out. Here's the most common method, broken down into three easy steps.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1: Convert the percentage to a decimal.</strong><br>The word "percent" literally means "per 100." So, to get the decimal version of a percentage, you just divide it by 100. In this case: 15 ÷ 100 = 0.15.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2: Find the discount amount.</strong><br>Now, multiply the original price by the decimal you just found. This tells you how much money you'll be saving.
    <br><em>$120 x 0.15 = $18</em><br>
    So, the discount is <strong>$18</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3: Calculate the final price.</strong><br>Simply subtract the discount amount ($18) from the original price ($120) to find what you'll actually pay.
    <br><em>$120 - $18 = $102</em><br>
    And there you have it! The final price after taking 15% off is <strong>$102</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Faster Way to Calculate the Final Price</h3>
<p>If you want to skip a step and find the final price directly, you can use this little trick.</p>
<p>If you're getting 15% off, it means you're still paying for the remaining 85% of the original price (100% - 15% = 85%).</p>
<p>Just convert 85% to a decimal (0.85) and multiply it by the original price:</p>
<p><em>$120 x 0.85 = $102</em></p>
<p>Both methods get you to the same correct answer!</p>

<h2>What About Other Percentages?</h2>
<p>Now you know how to work out 15% off 120. But what if the discount is 25%? Or the price is something less straightforward, like $89.95? The math is the same, but it can get tedious to do by hand, especially when you're in a hurry.</p>

<p>For those moments, or for any other percentage problem, we've designed a simple tool to help. For a quick and accurate answer every time, feel free to use <a href="../index.html">our free percentage calculator</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this quick guide has helped you not only find the answer but also understand how to tackle discounts with confidence. Happy saving!</p>
