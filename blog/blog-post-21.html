                <h1># What is 20% Off of 300? A Simple Calculation Guide</h1>
                <p>Picture this: you've found an item you love, and it's priced at $300. Even better, there's a sale sign that says "20% Off Today!" It's a great deal, but what does that mean for your wallet? How much do you actually save, and what's the final price you'll pay?</p>

<p>Don't worry, we're here to break it down for you. Let's get straight to the numbers.</p>

<h2>The Quick Answer</h2>

<p>For those in a hurry, here are the essential figures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The discount is <strong>$60</strong>.</li>
    <li>The final price after taking 20% off of 300 is <strong>$240</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But how did we get there? Understanding the process is simple and can help you calculate any discount on the fly. Let's explore the methods.</p>

<h2>How to Calculate the Discount Amount</h2>
<p>The first step is to figure out what "20% of 300" actually is. This number represents your savings.</p>

<h3>Method 1: The Decimal Method</h3>
<p>This is one of the most straightforward ways to calculate a percentage. The key is to convert the percentage into a decimal.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Convert the percentage to a decimal:</strong> 20% becomes 0.20. (Just divide the percentage number by 100, or move the decimal point two places to the left).</li>
    <li><strong>Multiply the original number by the decimal:</strong> 300 x 0.20 = 60.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, the discount you get is $60.</p>

<h3>Method 2: The 10% Mental Math Trick</h3>
<p>This is a fantastic shortcut for doing math in your head. It works great for percentages that are multiples of 10, like 20%.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Find 10% of the number first:</strong> To find 10% of any number, you just move the decimal point one place to the left. For 300, 10% is 30.0, or simply 30.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiply to get to your target percentage:</strong> Since you need 20%, and you know what 10% is, you just double it. 30 x 2 = 60.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, you've quickly found that the discount is $60.</p>

<h2>How to Find the Final Price</h2>
<p>Now that you know your discount is $60, finding the final price is just one simple subtraction away.</p>
<p>Simply take the original price and subtract the discount amount you just calculated.</p>
<p><strong>Original Price - Discount = Final Price</strong></p>
<p><strong>$300 - $60 = $240</strong></p>
<p>So, the item that was originally $300 will cost you $240 after the 20% discount. A nice saving!</p>

<h2>Need a Faster Way?</h2>
<p>Understanding these methods is incredibly useful for everyday situations. However, when you're in a rush or dealing with more complicated numbers (like 17.5% off of $83.99), doing the math by hand can be a hassle.</p>
<p>For those moments, the quickest and most reliable solution is to use a dedicated tool. For any percentage problem you face, check out <a href="../index.html">our free percentage calculator</a>. It gives you an instant, accurate answer without any of the guesswork.</p>
<p>We hope this guide has made calculating discounts a little clearer. Happy shopping and happy saving!</p>
