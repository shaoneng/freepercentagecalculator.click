                <h1><h1>What is 17 Percent of 80? A Simple Step-by-Step Guide</h1></h1>
                <p>Ever found yourself staring at a price tag with a weird discount, or trying to solve a homework problem, and you're faced with a question like "what is 17 percent of 80?" You're not alone! Percentages are a part of daily life, and knowing how to calculate them is a fantastic skill to have. Don't worry, it's easier than it looks.</p>

<p>Let's get straight to the point. The quick answer is:</p>

<p><strong>17% of 80 is 13.6.</strong></p>

<p>But how do we get that answer? Let's break it down so you can solve any percentage problem you come across.</p>

<h2>How to Calculate 17% of 80</h2>

<p>The easiest way to find the percentage of a number is to convert the percentage into a decimal and then multiply. It's just two simple steps.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Convert the Percentage to a Decimal</h3>

<p>The word "percent" literally means "per hundred." So, to convert a percentage to a decimal, you just need to divide it by 100. A simple trick is to move the decimal point two places to the left.</p>

<p>For our problem, 17% becomes:</p>
<p><strong>17 / 100 = 0.17</strong></p>

<h3>Step 2: Multiply the Decimal by the Original Number</h3>

<p>Now that you have your decimal, all you need to do is multiply it by the number you want to find the percentage of, which in this case is 80.</p>

<p><strong>0.17 * 80 = 13.6</strong></p>

<p>And there you have it! You've successfully calculated that 17% of 80 is <strong>13.6</strong>.</p>

<h2>A Quick Way to Check Your Answer</h2>

<p>Does the answer make sense? Let's do a quick mental check:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We know that 10% of 80 is 8 (just move the decimal one place to the left).</li>
    <li>We also know that 20% of 80 would be double that, which is 16.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 17% is between 10% and 20%, our answer should be between 8 and 16. Our result, 13.6, fits perfectly in that range!</p>

<h2>Need a Faster Way?</h2>

<p>Understanding the math is a great skill. But sometimes, you're in a hurry or dealing with much more complicated numbers. For those moments, a calculator is your best friend.</p>
