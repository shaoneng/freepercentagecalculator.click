                <h1><h1>What is 20% Off of 300? A Simple Guide to Your Discount</h1></h1>
                <p>Whether you're shopping during a big sale or just trying to work out a budget, percentage discounts are everywhere. A common question you might type into your phone is, "What is 20% off of 300?" You're in the right place! We'll give you the quick answer and show you how to figure it out for yourself.</p>

<p><b>The short answer is: 20% off of 300 is 240. You would save $60.</b></p>

<p>But how do we get that number? Understanding the math is simple, and it can help you make quick decisions next time you're out shopping. Let's break it down.</p>

<h2>How to Calculate 20% off of 300: Step-by-Step</h2>

<p>There are two very easy ways to calculate the final price. Both will give you the same correct answer, so you can pick the one that makes the most sense to you!</p>

<h3>Method 1: Find the Discount Amount First</h3>
<p>This method focuses on figuring out how much money you're saving first, then subtracting that from the original price.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Step 1: Convert the percentage to a decimal.</b><br>To do this, you just move the decimal point two places to the left. So, 20% becomes 0.20.</li>
    <li><b>Step 2: Multiply the decimal by the original price.</b><br>This tells you the value of the discount. In this case: 0.20 x 300 = 60. This means your savings are $60.</li>
    <li><b>Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original price.</b><br>This gives you the final price you'll pay. So: 300 - 60 = 240.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method 2: Calculate the Final Price Directly</h3>
<p>This method is a little faster as it skips a step. Here, you calculate the percentage of the price you will actually pay.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Step 1: Subtract the discount percentage from 100%.</b><br>Since you're getting 20% off, you'll be paying 80% of the original price. (100% - 20% = 80%).</li>
    <li><b>Step 2: Convert the remaining percentage to a decimal.</b><br>Just like before, move the decimal point two places to the left. So, 80% becomes 0.80.</li>
    <li><b>Step 3: Multiply this decimal by the original price.</b><br>This gives you the final price directly. So: 0.80 x 300 = 240.</li>
</ul>
