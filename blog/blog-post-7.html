                <h1># How to Calculate Percentage: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
                <p>Ever been in a store during a big sale, trying to figure out how much you're <em>actually</em> saving? Or maybe you're looking at your test results and want to understand your score. Percentages are everywhere, from shopping and finance to statistics and science. While they can seem a bit intimidating, the good news is that they’re quite simple to calculate once you get the hang of it.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through the essential formulas and steps in a clear, human-like way. Let's dive in!</p>

<h2>So, What Exactly Is a Percentage?</h2>
<p>Before we start calculating, let's quickly recap what a percentage is. The word "percent" comes from the Latin phrase <em>per centum</em>, which means "per hundred."</p>
<p>So, a percentage is simply a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. For example, if you say 50%, you're saying 50 out of 100. If you ate 25% of a pizza, you ate 25 out of every 100 pieces (or, more realistically, 2 slices out of 8!). It's a universal way to talk about parts of a whole.</p>

<h2>The 3 Main Types of Percentage Calculations</h2>
<p>Most percentage problems you'll encounter fall into one of three categories. We'll break down each one with a simple formula and a real-world example.</p>

<h3>1. How to Find the Percentage of a Number</h3>
<p>This is the most common type of calculation. You want to find what a certain percentage of a whole number is. For example, calculating a 15% tip or a 30% discount.</p>
<p><strong>The Formula:</strong> (Percentage / 100) * Whole Number</p>
<p>A simpler way to do this is to convert the percentage into a decimal first and then multiply.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100 (or just moving the decimal point two places to the left). For example, 20% becomes 0.20.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Multiply this decimal by the whole number.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example: Calculating a Discount</h4>
<p>Let's say a jacket you want is $80, but it's on sale for 25% off. How much money do you save?</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Convert 25% to a decimal: 25 / 100 = 0.25</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Multiply the decimal by the total price: 0.25 * $80 = $20</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You save $20 on the jacket.</p>

<h3>2. How to Calculate What Percentage One Number Is of Another</h3>
<p>This type of calculation is used when you have two numbers and you want to know how the smaller number relates to the larger one. For example, you answered 45 questions correctly on a 50-question test and want to know your score.</p>
<p><strong>The Formula:</strong> (Part / Whole) * 100 = Percentage</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the "part" and the "whole." The part is the smaller amount you're comparing, and the whole is the total amount.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Divide the part by the whole.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example: Finding Your Test Score</h4>
<p>You scored 45 correct answers (the "part") out of a total of 50 questions (the "whole").</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Divide the part by the whole: 45 / 50 = 0.9</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Multiply by 100: 0.9 * 100 = 90%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You scored 90% on the test. Well done!</p>

<h3>3. How to Calculate Percentage Increase or Decrease</h3>
<p>This is very useful for tracking changes over time, like seeing if your social media followers have grown or how much a stock price has changed.</p>
<p><strong>The Formula:</strong> ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Subtract the old value from the new value to find the difference.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Divide that difference by the original (old) value.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Multiply by 100 to see the percentage change. A positive answer is a percentage increase, and a negative answer is a decrease.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example: Calculating a Price Increase</h4>
<p>Last year, your favorite coffee cost $4. This year, the price went up to $4.50. What is the percentage increase?</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the difference: $4.50 - $4.00 = $0.50</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Divide by the old price: $0.50 / $4.00 = 0.125</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Multiply by 100: 0.125 * 100 = 12.5%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The price of the coffee increased by 12.5%.</p>

<h2>The Easiest Method: Use a Calculator</h2>
<p>Understanding how to do these calculations by hand is a fantastic skill. However, in the real world, you often need a fast and reliable answer without juggling formulas in your head. That's where technology comes in.</p>
